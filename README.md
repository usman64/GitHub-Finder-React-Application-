# GitHub-Finder-React-Application

I developed this small React application to learn and implemment the Context API and React Hooks. 
- This application can search for GitHub users, and fetch necessary details of from user profiles including user repositories by making requests to the Github API. 
-React Router was used for routing in this application. 
-I deployed it to Netlify, a demo can viewed on the link provided below:
