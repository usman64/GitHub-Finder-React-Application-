# GitHub-Finder-React-Application

I developed this small React application to learn and implemment the **Context API and React Hooks** from an online Course. 
- This application can search for GitHub users, and fetch necessary details from user profiles including user repositories by making requests to the Github API. 
- React Router was used for routing in this application. 
- I deployed it to Netlify, a demo can viewed on the link provided below:
